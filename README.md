JointTrip.Web is a project developed using the Spring framework during my studies. It is a blog about mountain trips where the admin can add posts and manage them. 
The project's database is in PostgreSQL. Project features functionalities such as a table of the most active users, the ability to add and like comments, as well as adding posts and sub-posts with descriptions and images.
